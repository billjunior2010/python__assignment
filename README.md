# python__assignment
a program that goes through a matrix and removes a list containing just strings and convert to uppercase and also gets a list of integers and gets the prime number from them and any list with mixed data type is ignored
I changed the initial name from Matrix to a name I could easily understand and work with
And I did a lot of printing for testing purposes
